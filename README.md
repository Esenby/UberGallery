Simple Installation
-------------------
Copy `resources/sample.galleryConfig.ini` to `resources/galleryConfig.ini` and modify the settings
to your liking.

Upload `index.php`, `resources/` and `gallery-images/` to your web server.

Upload images to the `gallery-images/` directory.

Make the `resources/cache/` directory writable by the web server:
    
    chmod 777 -R /path/to/resources/cache
    
Open your web browser and load the page where you installed UberGallery.


Custom Installation
-------------------
Copy `resources/sample.galleryConfig.ini` to `resources/galleryConfig.ini` and modify the settings
to your liking.

Upload the `resources/` folder to your web server.

Insert the following code into the PHP page where you would like the gallery to be displayed
(be sure to change the include and image folder path to match your configuration):
    
    <?php include_once('path/to/resources/UberGallery.php'); $gallery = UberGallery::init()->createGallery('path/to/images-folder'); ?>
    
Include the UberGallery and desired Colorbox style sheet in your page header:
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/resources/UberGallery.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/resources/colorbox/{1-5}/colorbox.css" />
    
Include the jQuery and Colorbox javascript files in your page header:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/resources/colorbox/jquery.colorbox.js"></script>
    
Include the Colorbox jquery call in your header:

    <script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("a[rel='colorbox']").colorbox({maxWidth: "90%", maxHeight: "90%", opacity: ".5"});
    });
    </script>
    
Upload images to your images directory.

Make the `resources/cache/` directory writable by the web server.
    
    chmod 777 -R /path/to/resources/cache
        
Open your web browser and load the page where you installed UberGallery.

----------------
SSH into the your server and clone the UberGallery repository:

    git clone git://github.com/UberGallery/UberGallery.git /path/to/gallery-directory
    
CD to your UberGallery installation and initialize the submodules:

    cd /path/to/gallery-directory
    git submodule update --init

Copy `resources/sample.galleryConfig.ini` to `resources/galleryConfig.ini` and modify the settings

    cp resource/sample.galleryConfig.ini resources/galleryConfig.ini
    nano resources/galleryConfig.ini

Make the `resources/cache/` directory writable by the web server.
    
    chmod 777 -R resources/cache
